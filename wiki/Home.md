# ArcheonGUI Documentation

Welcome to **ArcheonGUI** — a visual architecture editor for [Archeon](https://github.com/danaia/archeon)-powered projects.

## 🎯 What is ArcheonGUI?

ArcheonGUI is an interactive canvas-based visualization tool that lets you:
- **Visualize** your entire project architecture at a glance
- **Explore** relationships between components
- **Navigate** complex systems intuitively
- **Edit** your ARCHEON.arcon files with visual feedback
- **Validate** your architecture in real-time

> **What is Archeon?** [Archeon](https://github.com/danaia/archeon) is a glyph-based architecture notation for describing component structures and relationships. Learn more in the [Archeon documentation](https://github.com/danaia/archeon/wiki).
